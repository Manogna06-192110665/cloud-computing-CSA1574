vmware day 2
Experiment 6:-
Aim:-
To Demonstrate virtualization by Installing Type-2 Hypervisor in your device, create and
configure VM image with a Host Operating system (Either Windows/Linux).
Procedure :
STEP 1: Download vmware  workstation and installed as vmware 2 hypervisor
STEP2: Download UBUNTU or TINY OS as ISO image file
STEP 3: In vmware workstation -> create new vm
STEP 4: Do the basic configuration settings
STEP 5: Created  TINYOS virtual machine
STEP 6: Launch the VM


Experiment 7:-

AIM:-
To create a virtual machine with 1 VCPU,2GB RAM and 15GB storage disk using  a type 2 virtualization software
procedure :
STEP 1: Go to VMWARE work
STEP2: RIGHT CLICK THE VM AND GOTO THE SETTINGS
STEP 3: Add hardware wizard and select SCSI and next
STEP 4: Create new virtual disk
STEP 5: Select the disk size as 2.0 and select split virtual disk into multi files.
STEP 6: Give name and click the finish


Experiment 8:-
Aim:-
TO CREATE A VIRTUAL HARD DISK AND ALLOCATE THE STORAGE USING VM WARE WORKSTATION

procedure :
STEP 1: GOTO VMWARE WORKSTATION
STEP2: RIGHT CLICK THE VM AND GOTO THE SETTINGS
STEP 3: ADD HARDWARE WIZARD AND SELECT SCSI AND CLICK NEXT
STEP 4: CREATE NEW VIRTUAL DISK
STEP 5: SELCT THE DISK SIZE AS 2.0. AND SELCT SPLIT VIRTUAL DISK INTO MULTIFILES.
STEP 6: GIVE NAME AND CLICK THE FINISH



Experiment 9:-
Aim:-
CREATE A SNAPSHOT AND CLONING OF A VM AND TEST IT BY LOADING THE PREVIOUS
VERSION/CLONED VM.
procedure :
STEP 1: GOTO VMWARE WORKSTATION
STEP 2: CREATE FILES ON DESKTOP
STEP 2: CLICK ON VM AND SELECTS SNAPSHOT-> TAKE SNAPSHOT.
STEP 4: SNAPSHOT IS BEING DONE


Experiment 10:-
Aim:-
CREATE A CLONING OF A VM AND TEST IT BY LOADING THE PREVIOUS VERSION/CLONED
VM
procedure :
STEP 1: GO TO VM AND GOTO MANAGE AND CLICK CLONE
STEP 2: CLICK CLONE
STEP 3: SELECT THE FULL CLONE
STEP 4: AFTER CLONE AGAIN OR VM IS OPENED


Experiment 11:-
Aim:-
Change Hardware compatibility of a VM (Either by clone/create new one) which is already
created and configured.
procedure :
STEP 1: GO TO VM AND GOTO MANAGE
STEP 2: CLICK ON CHANGE HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
STEP 3: CHOOSE THE HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
STEP 4: NAME THE CLONE
STEP 5:THE HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY IS CHANGE SUCCESSFULL
